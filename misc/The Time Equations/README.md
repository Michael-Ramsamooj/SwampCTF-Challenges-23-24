# The Time Equations

This solution involves solving multivariable linear equations quickly.

We can easily read data with the [pwntools](https://docs.pwntools.com/en/stable/) library and then can use [numpy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.linalg.solve.html) to solve the equations with matrices and row reduction
