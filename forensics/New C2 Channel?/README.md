# New C2 Channel?

This challenge was based on a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwSudydjRXc) by [@netspooky](https://github.com/netspooky) I saw years ago that I thought would be a good CTF challenge 

I've attached the code to generate the challenge ([scroller.py](./scroller.py)), which was taken from [@netspooky](https://github.com/netspooky) as well (see [here](https://gist.github.com/netspooky/7345348bd315cafc8018d0dee1ae9e07))


## Solution
We can scroll through the relevant packets as such and write down the flag
